        <p>I grew up in Portland Oregon, and graduated from Metropolitan Learning Center, with awards in academic achievement for taking part in student government, operating the student store, and having some of my writing published. One of my poems received an award for outstanding creativity, and I did a reading of it at Powell's. I studied acting at The Evergreen State  College for one year. After some time working in a manufacturing plant, I am now attending Epicodus, in hopes of expanding  my  programming skillset.</p>
